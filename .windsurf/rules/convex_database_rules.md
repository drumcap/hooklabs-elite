# Convex Database Guidelines

## Schema guidelines
- Always define your schema in `convex/schema.ts`.
- Always import the schema definition functions from `convex/server`:
- System fields are automatically added to all documents and are prefixed with an underscore. The two system fields that are automatically added to all documents are `_creationTime` which has the validator `v.number()` and `_id` which has the validator `v.id(tableName)`.
- Always include all index fields in the index name. For example, if an index is defined as `["field1", "field2"]`, the index name should be "by_field1_and_field2".
- Index fields must be queried in the same order they are defined. If you want to be able to query by "field1" then "field2" and by "field2" then "field1", you must create separate indexes.

## TypeScript guidelines
- You can use the helper typescript type `Id` imported from './_generated/dataModel' to get the type of the id for a given table. For example if there is a table called 'users' you can use `Id<'users'>` to get the type of the id for that table.
- If you need to define a `Record` make sure that you correctly provide the type of the key and value in the type. For example a validator `v.record(v.id('users'), v.string())` would have the type `Record<Id<'users'>, string>`. Below is an example of using `Record` with an `Id` type in a query:
```typescript
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { Doc, Id } from "./_generated/dataModel";

export const exampleQuery = query({
    args: { userIds: v.array(v.id("users")) },
    returns: v.record(v.id("users"), v.string()),
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
        const idToUsername: Record<Id<"users">, string> = {};
        for (const userId of args.userIds) {
            const user = await ctx.db.get(userId);
            if (user) {
                idToUsername[user._id] = user.username;
            }
        }

        return idToUsername;
    },
});
```
- Be strict with types, particularly around id's of documents. For example, if a function takes in an id for a document in the 'users' table, take in `Id<'users'>` rather than `string`.
- Always use `as const` for string literals in discriminated union types.
- When using the `Array` type, make sure to always define your arrays as `const array: Array<T> = [...];`
- When using the `Record` type, make sure to always define your records as `const record: Record<KeyType, ValueType> = {...};`
- Always add `@types/node` to your `package.json` when using any Node.js built-in modules.

## Full text search guidelines
- A query for "10 messages in channel '#general' that best match the query 'hello hi' in their body" would look like:

```typescript
const messages = await ctx.db
  .query("messages")
  .withSearchIndex("search_body", (q) =>
    q.search("body", "hello hi").eq("channel", "#general"),
  )
  .take(10);
```

## Query guidelines
- Do NOT use `filter` in queries. Instead, define an index in the schema and use `withIndex` instead.
- Convex queries do NOT support `.delete()`. Instead, `.collect()` the results, iterate over them, and call `ctx.db.delete(row._id)` on each result.
- Use `.unique()` to get a single document from a query. This method will throw an error if there are multiple documents that match the query.
- When using async iteration, don't use `.collect()` or `.take(n)` on the result of a query. Instead, use the `for await (const row of query)` syntax.

### Ordering
- By default Convex always returns documents in ascending `_creationTime` order.
- You can use `.order('asc')` or `.order('desc')` to pick whether a query is in ascending or descending order. If the order isn't specified, it defaults to ascending.
- Document queries that use indexes will be ordered based on the columns in the index and can avoid slow table scans.

## Mutation guidelines
- Use `ctx.db.replace` to fully replace an existing document. This method will throw an error if the document does not exist.
- Use `ctx.db.patch` to shallow merge updates into an existing document. This method will throw an error if the document does not exist.
